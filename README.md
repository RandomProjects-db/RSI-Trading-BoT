# RSI-Trading-BoT

A trading BOT that follow the Relative Strength Index (RSI) strategy, it is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally the RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30.

The values of the RSI oscillator, typically measured over a 14-day period (but you can set it to the period you like), fluctuate between zero and 100. The Relative Strength Index indicates oversold market conditions when below 30 and overbought market conditions when above 70. It is frequently used by swing traders. They look for signals of waning or strengthening momentum in short to intermediate term price movements within a market. Overbought or oversold conditions often immediately precede short-term trend changes that present trading opportunities.
